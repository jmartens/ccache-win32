<pre><tt>  A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
  ==========================

  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
  Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
  as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
  principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
  National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
  in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
  software.

  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
  BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
  year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
  Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
  Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
  non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
  Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
  the PSF.

  All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
  the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
  releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
  the various releases.

  Footnotes:

  (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
      the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
      a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
      GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
      other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
      because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
      CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
      is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
  direction to make these releases possible.
